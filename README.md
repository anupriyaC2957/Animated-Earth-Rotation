# Animated-Earth-Rotation
The code creates a visually stunning representation of the Earth, showcasing seamless transitions between day and night cycles. 
The circular wrapper, centered within the viewport, provides a three-dimensional effect with shadows. 
Two Earth elements, distinguished by day and night textures, rotate continuously, offering a captivating visual experience.
The animation unfolds over a 25-second cycle, gracefully shifting the background-position to simulate the Earth's rotation. 
This project combines creativity and coding to deliver an immersive and aesthetically pleasing depiction of our planet's dynamic nature.
